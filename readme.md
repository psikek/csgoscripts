# Counter-Strike Global Offensive Scripts
My personal CS:GO Scripts.
## Installation
### Windows
Download the repo as a zip, and extract it to:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo`

*(this will be slightly different if you have CS installed on a different drive)*
### Linux
Just run these commands and you should be good to go.

```
git https://github.com/psikek/csgoscripts
cp csgoscripts/. ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\
```
## Usage
In CS:GO, open the command line and run `exec autoexec` to run the script.

## Launch Options
`-novid -high -language best -tickrate 128 +exec autoexec.cfg -tickrate 128 -rate 128000 -freq 144 -refresh 144`
