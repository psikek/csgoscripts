# Counter-Strike Global Offensive Scripts
My personal CS:GO Scripts.
## Installation
### Windows
Download the repo as a zip, and extract it to:

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

*(this may be slightly different if you have CS:GO installed on a different drive)*
### Linux
Similarly to Windows, just do these commands

```
git https://github.com/psikek/csgoscripts
cp csgoscripts/. ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\
```
## Usage
In CS:GO, run `exec autoexec` to run the script.
