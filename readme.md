# Counter-Strike Global Offensive Scripts
My personal CS:GO Scripts.
## Installation
### Windows
Move to the contents of the directory to 

`C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

*(this may be slightly different if you have CS:GO installed on a different drive)*
### Linux
Similarly to Windows, just do these commands

```
git https://github.com/psikek/csgoscripts
cd csgoscripts/. ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg\
```
